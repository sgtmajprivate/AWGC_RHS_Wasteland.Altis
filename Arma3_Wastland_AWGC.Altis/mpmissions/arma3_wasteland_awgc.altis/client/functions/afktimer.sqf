	Version: 1.0.1

	Creation Date: 7:05 PM 04/11/2016
	Modification Date: 1:36 PM 25/11/2016
	
	Description:
	For use with A3Wasteland 1.Xx mission (A3Wasteland.com). This script is a player AFK timer.
	
	The script checks for player velocity and the direction the player is looking, if both are
	idle for greater than a second it will trigger the AFK timer. If the player moves or looks
	around with the camera, the AFK timer resets. If the player is idle for too long (default 10
	minutes), it will result in a notice on screen and the player kicked back to the lobby.
	
	*Use this script in conjuction with BEC to also kick idle players from the lobby.
	
	Place this file at...
	\client\functions\afkTimer.sqf
	
	Edit file...
	\client\init.sqf
	
	And paste in at the end of the file...
	[] execVM "client\functions\afkTimer.sqf";
	
	Parameter(s):
	Example:
	
	Change Log:
	1.0.0 -	original base script.
	1.0.1 -	fix for headless client kick.
